  <h2>WHAT IS FLI?</h2>
  <p>Family Leadership Initiative (FLI) is AIPAC&rsquo;s brand new, exclusive, year-long training course for New York Metro area high school students and parents. The program is launching in January 2019 and is limited to 10 families.</p>
  <p>Families will graduate with concrete tools, effective strategies, and key relationships to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship on your campus and in your community. Throughout the year, parents and students will attend interactive training
    workshops both together and separately. They will implement lessons learned by completing initiatives that tangibly impact U.S. support for Israel.</p>
  <p>Over the course of a year, participants will learn the ins and outs of how AIPAC works and develop a deeper understanding of AIPAC&rsquo;s strategy. </p>
  <p>Perhaps most importantly, FLI will help families become effective pro-Israel activists together as a unit, empowering multiple generations with the knowledge and support system to make a difference.</p>
  <p>FLI is a selective program requiring candidates to submit an application before being accepted.</p>
